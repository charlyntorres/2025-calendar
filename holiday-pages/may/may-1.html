The first Labor Day parade took place in New York City on September 5, 1882, organized by the Central Labor Union.</li>
                                    <li><b>Adoption of May 1st:</b> May 1 became associated with labor movements worldwide after the 1886 Haymarket Affair in Chicago, where workers protesting for an eight-hour workday faced violence.

                                    <li><b>Philippines Labor Day:</b> In the Philippines, the first official Labor Day was celebrated on May 1, 1903, with a massive rally organized by the Union Obrera Democratica Filipina (UODF). Workers gathered to demand fair wages, better working conditions, and recognition of labor unions.</li>
                                </ul>
