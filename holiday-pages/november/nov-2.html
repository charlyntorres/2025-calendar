                                <h2>All Souls' Day: Remembering the Faithful Departed</h2>
                                <p>All Souls' Day, or Araw ng mga Kaluluwa, is observed every November 2 in the Philippines and across the Catholic world. This solemn day is dedicated to praying for the souls of the departed who are believed to be in purgatory, undergoing purification before entering heaven. In the Philippines, it is closely tied to All Saints' Day and collectively referred to as Undas, a cherished time for honoring and remembering loved ones who have passed away.</p>
