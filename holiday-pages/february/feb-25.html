                                <h2>Commemorating the People Power Anniversary: A Celebration of Freedom and Unity</h2>
                                <p>The People Power Anniversary, observed annually in the Philippines on February 25, commemorates the historic EDSA People Power Revolution of 1986. This peaceful uprising marked the end of Ferdinand Marcos' 20-year regime and restored democracy to the nation. It stands as a testament to the strength of collective action and the unwavering desire for freedom and justice. In this blog, we'll explore the origins, significance, and unique traditions tied to this remarkable event.</p>

                                <h3>The Background of the People Power Revolution</h3>
                                <p>The EDSA People Power Revolution was a four-day peaceful demonstration that took place from February 22 to 25, 1986, on Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA) in Metro Manila. This uprising was the culmination of years of unrest under the authoritarian rule of President Ferdinand Marcos, whose regime was marked by corruption, human rights violations, and the imposition of martial law.</p>
                                <p>The assassination of opposition leader Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino Jr. in 1983 further fueled the public's dissatisfaction, galvanizing Filipinos to demand change. Following a contested snap election in February 1986, where widespread fraud was alleged, the Filipino people rose up in unity to reclaim their democracy.</p>

                                <p>February 25, 1986, marks the day that Ferdinand Marcos fled Malacañang Palace and Corazon "Cory" Aquino, the widow of Ninoy Aquino, assumed the presidency. This peaceful transfer of power symbolized the triumph of democracy over dictatorship and became a beacon of hope for nonviolent resistance movements worldwide.</p>
