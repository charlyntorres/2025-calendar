                                <p>The origins of Christmas Day trace back to the early Christian Church in the 4th century.

                                <p>The first official Christmas celebration was held in Rome in 336 AD. Over time, the day evolved into a global tradition, blending Christian teachings with cultural customs unique to different regions of the world.</p>
