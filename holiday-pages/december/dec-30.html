                                <h2>Rizal Day: Honoring the Legacy of a National Hero</h2>
                                <p>Rizal Day, observed every December 30, is a national holiday in the Philippines that commemorates the life and legacy of Dr. José Rizal, the country's most revered national hero. This day marks the anniversary of his martyrdom, a moment in history that played a pivotal role in the fight for Philippine independence from Spanish colonial rule.</p>
                                <br>
