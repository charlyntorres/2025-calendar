                                <h2>Philippines' National Heroes Day: Honoring the Brave</h2>
                                <p>Every last Monday of August, Filipinos celebrate National Heroes Day (Araw ng mga Bayani) to honor the sacrifices of the countless heroes who fought for the country's freedom and independence. It's a day of reflection, gratitude, and inspiration, reminding Filipinos of their rich history and the brave individuals who shaped the nation.</p>
                                <br>

                                <h3>The History of National Heroes Day</h3>
                                <h5>Origins of the Celebration</h5>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>National Heroes Day was first celebrated in 1931, during the administration of Governor-General Dwight F. Davis.</li>
                                        <li>The Philippine Legislature enacted Act No. 3827, declaring the last Sunday of August as a national holiday to commemorate all Filipino heroes, both known and unknown.</li>
                                        <li>In 2007, the date was moved to the last Monday of August, following the Holiday Economics Act to encourage long weekends for economic and cultural purposes.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                <h5>Why No Specific Hero is Named?</h5>
                                <p>Unlike other holidays dedicated to specific individuals (e.g., Rizal Day or Ninoy Aquino Day), National Heroes Day recognizes the collective efforts of all Filipinos who contributed to the country's history and freedom. From Lapu-Lapu in the Battle of Mactan to the unsung heroes of the modern era, it's a day for everyone who made sacrifices for the nation.</p>
                                <br>
