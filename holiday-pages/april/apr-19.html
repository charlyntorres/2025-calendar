                                <h2>Black Saturday: A Day of Mourning and Reflection</h2>
                                <p>Black Saturday, also known as Holy Saturday, is the final day of Holy Week and the day before Easter Sunday. It is a time of quiet reflection, mourning, and anticipation, commemorating the period when Jesus Christ's body lay in the tomb after His crucifixion.</p>
                                <p>Unlike the vibrant celebrations of Easter, Black Saturday is observed with silence and solemnity, offering Christians an opportunity to meditate on the sacrifice of Christ and prepare their hearts for the joy of His resurrection.</p>
                                <br>

                                <h3>The Significance of Black Saturday</h3>
                                <p>Black Saturday marks the end of the Paschal Triduum, the three-day period of Christ's Passion, Death, and Resurrection. It is a day of stillness and waiting, as the faithful remember the grief of the disciples and the Virgin Mary after the crucifixion. Traditionally, it is a day to contemplate the mystery of Christ's descent into the dead, as described in the Apostles' Creed:</p>
                                <p><i>"He descended into hell; on the third day He rose again from the dead."</i></p>
                                <p>This descent is seen as a victory over death, where Christ opened the gates of heaven for the righteous who had died before His resurrection.</p>
                                <br>
